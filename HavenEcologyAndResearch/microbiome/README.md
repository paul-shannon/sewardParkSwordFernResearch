# Sword Fern Microbiome Project
### New Features!
2020-11-30
A key has been added with units and other descriptive notes for the other raw data files.

2020-11-20
In the data_understory.csv and data_trees.csv files, the scientific names have been updated to their current binomials (eg Blechnum spicant -> Struthiopteris spicant). Native status (yes/no) has also been added.

### Description
The goal of the sword fern microbiome project is to identify the causal factor behind the sword fern die-off phenomenon. This repository contains preliminary data, photos and other documentation from our survey of Schmitz Preserve Park and Seward Park, both located in Seattle, Washington.

### Contents
Raw data files are stored in the main repository:
| File Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| data_ferns.csv | information on the specific fern that was sampled |
| data_key.csv | descriptions of the attribute fields in the other data files |
| data_meta.csv | site conditions and other misc information for each plot |
| data_trees.csv | trees in each plot |
| data_understory.csv | understory plant community in each plot |

Photos of the sampled ferns are located in the photos_ferns_sampled sub-folder. Some ferns have additional photos of their fronds or rhizomes, located in the photos_ferns_supplemental sub-folder. Numbers correspond to plot_id.

Preliminary reports and miscellaneous documentation is stored in the docs folder.

### Acknowledgements
Thank you, Andres Barrera, for your hard work in the field and lab. Much thanks also goes to the good folks at Friends of Seward Park, MPG Ranch, SoundBio Lab and Seattle Parks and Recreation. Your feedback and support was crucial to the success of our research. This project was also made possible through a generous grant from 100 Women Who Care.
